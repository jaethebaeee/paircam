## 🎯 What Changed in This Deploy

### Fixed: Video Toggle Connection
**Files Updated:**
- `packages/frontend/src/components/LandingPage.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/components/VideoChat/index.tsx`

**Problem:** Video toggle on landing page was UI-only (didn't affect actual video state)

**Solution:** Connected toggle through state management:
1. LandingPage captures `isVideoEnabled` state
2. Passes to App component via `onStartCall`
3. App stores as `initialVideoEnabled`
4. Passes to VideoChat component
5. VideoChat uses to initialize video state

**Result:** Toggle now actually works! 🎉

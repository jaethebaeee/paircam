## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend Not Updating?
```bash
# Force redeploy from Vercel dashboard
# Or make a small change and push again
echo "# Force rebuild" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Force redeploy"
git push origin main
```

### Build Failing?
```bash
# Check Vercel logs
# Common issues:
# - Missing environment variables
# - TypeScript errors
# - Import issues

# Test build locally first
cd /tmp/omegle-clone/packages/frontend
npm run build
```

### Backend Not Updating?
```bash
# Check if backend auto-deploys or needs manual push
# If manual:
cd /tmp/omegle-clone/packages/backend
npm run build
# Then deploy via your method (Docker, K8s, etc.)
```

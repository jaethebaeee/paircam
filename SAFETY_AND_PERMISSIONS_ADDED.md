### 3. Updated App Flow (`App.tsx`)

**New Flow:**
```
User enters name/age
       ↓
Clicks "Start Video Chat"
       ↓
Safety Modal appears
       ↓
User accepts guidelines
       ↓
Permission Modal appears
       ↓
User allows camera/mic
       ↓
Video chat starts
```

**State Management:**
- `showSafetyModal` - Controls safety modal visibility

- `safetyAccepted` - Tracks if user accepted guidelines
- `permissionsGranted` - Tracks if permissions were granted

**Benefits:**

## 🔄 Skip Button Improvements

### 1. Duplicate File Removed
**Deleted:** `packages/frontend/src/components/VideoChat.tsx`
**Reason:** Duplicate of `VideoChat/index.tsx`
**Impact:** Cleaner codebase, no confusion

### 2. Debounce Added
**Purpose:** Prevent rapid clicking spam
**Implementation:**
```tsx
const [isSkipping, setIsSkipping] = useState(false);

const handleNext = () => {
  if (isSkipping) return; // Prevent rapid clicks
  
  setIsSkipping(true);
  // ... skip logic ...
  
  setTimeout(() => setIsSkipping(false), 2000); // Re-enable after 2s
};
```

### 3. Visual Feedback
**Button States:**
- **Normal:** Pink/purple gradient, hover effects
- **Skipping:** Gray, disabled, spinning icon
- **Tooltip:** "Finding new match..." when skipping

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Users know the action is processing
- ✅ Prevents accidental double-clicks
- ✅ Better UX with clear feedback
- ✅ Prevents server spam

---

## 📊 Complete Skip Button Flow

### Frontend:
1. User clicks skip button
2. `handleNext()` checks if already skipping
3. Sets `isSkipping = true` (disables button)
4. Calls `signaling.endCall(sessionId)`
5. Clears chat messages
6. Calls `signaling.joinQueue()`
7. Re-enables button after 2 seconds

### Backend:
1. Receives `end-call` event
2. Cleans up session in Redis
3. Notifies peer of disconnection
4. Receives `join-queue` event
5. Checks rate limit (max 10/min)
6. Adds user to queue
7. Processes queue immediately
8. Finds match if available
9. Creates new session
10. Emits `matched` event to both users

### Rate Limiting:
- **Max:** 10 calls per minute per device
- **Tracked in:** Redis with TTL
- **Purpose:** Prevent abuse/spam
- **Error:** "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait."

## 🚀 Redeploy to Production (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)

Both Vercel and Railway should **automatically redeploy** when they detect the GitHub push!

**Check Status:**
- **Vercel**: Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) → Your project → See deployment progress
- **Railway**: Go to [railway.app/dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard) → Your project → See deployment progress

⏱️ **Wait time**: 2-5 minutes for both to finish

---

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy

If automatic deployment doesn't trigger:

#### Vercel (Frontend):
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click your project → **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click the **"..."** menu on latest deployment → **"Redeploy"**
4. Or click **"Visit"** to trigger a new deployment

#### Railway (Backend):
1. Go to [railway.app/dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click your project → Backend service
3. Click **"Deploy"** → **"Redeploy"**
4. Or push an empty commit to trigger:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Railway redeploy"
   git push origin main
   ```

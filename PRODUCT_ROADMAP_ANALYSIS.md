## üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. ‚ùå Text Mode Not Fully Implemented
**Status:** Frontend UI exists, backend logic MISSING  
**Impact:** HIGH - Feature is advertised but doesn't work properly  
**Business Risk:** User dissatisfaction, credibility loss

#### Current State:
- ‚úÖ Frontend has "Text Chat" button
- ‚úÖ Frontend shows text-only interface
- ‚ùå Backend has NO `isTextMode` or `textMode` field
- ‚ùå Backend doesn't track or match text-only users
- ‚ùå WebRTC connections still attempted in text mode

#### What's Missing:
```typescript
// Backend needs:
interface QueueUser {
  // ... existing fields ...
  isTextMode?: boolean;  // ‚ùå MISSING
}

// Matchmaking logic needs:
- Text-only users should match with text-only users
- Or text-only users can match with anyone (video users just don't use video)
- Session should track if it's text-only
- No WebRTC offer/answer for text-only sessions
```

#### Fix Required:
1. Add `isTextMode` field to `QueueUser` interface
2. Pass `isTextMode` in `join-queue` event
3. Update matchmaking to prefer text-text matches
4. Skip WebRTC signaling for text-only sessions
5. Add analytics tracking for text vs video usage

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL

---

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è No Payment/Monetization System
**Status:** Premium features exist, but NO way to pay  
**Impact:** HIGH - Zero revenue potential  
**Business Risk:** Cannot sustain operations

#### Current State:
- ‚úÖ Premium features coded (gender filtering)
- ‚úÖ Backend checks `isPremium` status
- ‚ùå No Stripe integration
- ‚ùå No payment UI
- ‚ùå No subscription management
- ‚ùå Manual database flag only

#### What's Needed:
- Stripe integration for payments
- Subscription plans (monthly/yearly)
- One-time purchases (gifts, power-ups)
- Payment modal UI
- Receipt/invoice system
- Premium badge display
- Free trial system

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks  
**Priority:** üü† HIGH

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Anonymous Users = No Retention
**Status:** Device-based auth only, no accounts  
**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Users can't return to same account  
**Business Risk:** Low retention, no user data

#### Current State:
- Users identified by device ID only
- No email, no phone, no Google login
- Can't access account from different device
- Can't recover if they clear cookies
- No profile persistence

#### Strategic Questions:
- Is anonymity the product differentiator?
- Or should we add optional accounts?
- How do we monetize anonymous users?

**Recommendation:** Add OPTIONAL account system  
- Keep anonymous as default (differentiation)
- Allow linking device to email/phone (retention)
- Premium requires account (monetization)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week  
**Priority:** üü† HIGH

---

## üü° HIGH-PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

- ‚ùå No automated content moderation (AI/ML)
- ‚ùå No ban system
- ‚ùå No profanity filter in text chat
- ‚ùå No image recognition for NSFW content
- ‚ùå No age verification beyond checkbox

#### What's Needed:
- Admin dashboard for report review
- Ban system (temporary/permanent)
- Automated NSFW detection (AWS Rekognition, Google Vision API)
- Chat profanity filter
- User reputation system
- Appeals process
- Legal compliance (COPPA, GDPR)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

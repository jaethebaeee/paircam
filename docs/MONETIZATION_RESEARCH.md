# PairCam Monetization Research - Google Ads & Alternatives

## CRITICAL FINDING: AdSense Policy on Video Chat Apps

**Google AdSense explicitly PROHIBITS ads on video chat screens.**

As of August 2024, Google updated their policy:
> "Ads are prohibited on screens where the primary focus is a private communication like direct messages, live chats, **video-chats**, and private chatrooms."

This means **you CANNOT place Google AdSense ads on the video chat interface itself**. However, you CAN use AdSense on:
- Landing page
- About page
- Blog/content pages
- FAQ pages
- User profile pages (when not in chat)
- Waiting/queue pages (before matching)
